This directory contains the elements needed to verify the HRRR model against 
MesoWest weather stations. The primary purpose is to get weather analyses and
forecasts from the HRRR model and compare with the observations available
from the MesoWest database for stations within 25 miles of a major wildfire.
The secondary purpose is to do the same for a list of notable weather stations
in Utah (i.e. WBB, KSLC, NAA, UKBKB, etc...)
